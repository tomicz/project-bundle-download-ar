This is the challenge that I selected to do for an interview at Immersed. I decided to add challenge task points as a readme to not have to switch between an email and constantly look there. 
I can keep my tasks here in one place. Normally, at a normal project, I would not add something like this to a readme file on GitHub, I only do this for 
a reference.

**Challenge #2**

* You're creating a Storefront UI that pulls down a list of data of goods that can be purchased from an api (can be mocked with json).
* At your discretion, group the data in a way where the user needs to navigate to different tabs/menus, etc., in order to view.
* Upon selecting or hovering over the data, show a pop-up or UI that displays additional metadata (i.e., clicking on a chair reveals color, size, polycount [you can make up the data]).
* For 2-3 of the objects you choose, mock a way for them to "buy" the item and then import the asset directly into their space.

**Bonus Points:**
* Actual import of objects from an external source vs from within unity.
* Give the user the ability to place that object anywhere in the space.

**What we're looking for:**
1. Solid understanding of design principles (can you make the code optimized, modular and scalable?)
2. Approach to optimizations within the application (assume you're running on mobile devices and all assets should be performant)
3. Project structure and organization (are you only using SDKs needed, is the project organized, are you using assembly definitions?)
